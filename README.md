Analyze AirBnB data and write a bogplost

## Introduction
For this project I chose to analyze AirBnB data for Boston and Seattle. The packes needed to run the code are the usual packges included with Anaconda: numpy, matplotlib and pandas.

## Motivation
The questions I asked myself for this project were:
1. Are there any seasonality effects/do prices tend to be higher during certain times of the year?
1. Are there any significat differences between AirBnB prices between the two cities or are they similar?
1. Can we use the "% of available apartments" to predict the average price for an AirBnB booking?

## Relevant files
* DataScience_Project1_v2.ipynb: Python notebook I used to clean-up, plot and analyze the data
* calendar_boston.csv: ~ 1y of data for Boston AirBnB. Includes price for a day and boolean whether the apartment is available
* calendar_seattle.csv: ~ 1y of data for Seattle AirBnB. Includes price for a day and boolean whether the apartment is available
